## Motivation

This zone is a place where I hope people can exchange ideas on the Design Patterns which can be used in PLC. Im not particularly interested in explainers for the design patterns you choose to add. These sorts of repos already exist:
**[Stefan Hennekan](https://stefanhenneken.net/category/iec-61131-3-english/)** has done some exceptional work making Codesys versions of the design patterns. People like **[Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)** have a YouTube series explaining the patterns. What we are missing is a set of real world design pattern examples found in PLC.

## The Goal

The Goal of this repository is to accumulate a series of Design Pattern implementations using IEC 61131-3.
