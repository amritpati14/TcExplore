## How To Use the Zone

So you've read the README, you know what this zone is for. This area is for creating a set of examples of design patterns used in IEC 61131 applications. Is a mediator a good way of handling IO? Is an observer a good way of handling UDP comms, State pattern for state amchines can it work at scale?

If you already have examples, thats great feel free to add clean versions (im not asking for secrets here).

Create a PLC project within the existing solution, we will have a PLC project for each design pattern type allowing us to make a set of examples for each in a structured way.
