# Factory Method Pattern

## The Abstract Factory Pattern For

This sample was created to show the Abstract Factory Pattern applied to TwinCAT.

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational pattern, it is designed to decouple the creation of objects from the thing creating them. By shifting the creation into a class we simplyfy the creation and focus the control of the created objects in a single location.

You can find an explanation of the pattern here:

*[PatternGuru - Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)*

and a very good tutorial here:

*[Chris O - Abstract Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-GiuMmsXj4&t=1145)*



### NOTE

You need to set the class with the dynamic creation attribute

{attribute 'enable_dynamic_creation'}
