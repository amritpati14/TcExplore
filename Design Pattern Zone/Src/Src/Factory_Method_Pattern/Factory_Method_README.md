# Factory Method Pattern

## The Factory Pattern For XTS

This sample was created to show the Factory Method Pattern applied to TwinCAT XTS, specifically creating the elements contained within an XTS system.

The Factory is used to create instances of Mover, Track, Parts and Stations via an interface.

You can find an explanation of the pattern here:
