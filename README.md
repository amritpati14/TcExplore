## Motivation

I have created this project to contain a series of TwinCAT samples, but also to promote best practices like TDD. I want to learn myself how to apply the disciplines of modern software design to PLC code. I would like to share the experience, help and learn from others as I go.

## The Goal

This repository is an attempt to bring together those who want to learn, practice and contribute to the expansion of knowledge of software design principals in the PLC world.

So the goal is quite open, I dont intend to create a framework or conpendium of examples. But I suspect the project will move in that direction as we start to apply concepts from software architecture like ISP and DIP, which need a certain amount of complexity to enable non trivial examples.

But my goal is to learn and share, if that sounds good to you then please feel free to join in.
