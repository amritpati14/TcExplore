## Motivation

I have created this project to contain a series of TwinCAT samples, but also to promote best practices like TDD. I want to learn myself how to apply the disciplines of modern software design to PLC code. I would like to share the experience, help and learn from others as I go.

## The Goal

This repository is an attempt to bring together those who want to learn, practice and contribute to the expansion of knowledge of software design principals in the PLC world.

So the goal is quite open, I dont intend to create a framework or conpendium of examples. But I suspect the project will move in that direction as we start to apply concepts from software architecture like ISP and DIP, which need a certain amount of complexity to enable non trivial examples.

But my goal is to learn and share, if that sounds good to you then please feel free to join in.

## Background

Recently I have been in conversations with other PLC programmers about the 'right' way to program. It seems there are as many answers as people. I have been expanding my reading outside the PLC world, looking at IT software development practices, reading books like:

1. Waltzing with Bears, Tom DeMarco
2. Clean Code, Robert Martin
3. Head First Design Patterns
4. Clean Architecture, Robert Martin
5. Extreme Programming Explained, Kent Beck
6. Modern Software Engineering, David Farley

There were others, one readme we will have in this project will be a reading list.
These practices are actually used in the OT world, some practitioners are aware of this and actively study the techniques. Others actually use a lot of them without having a name to put to the process. 

These encompas everything from Test Driven Development, CI/CD practices, to method design on your function blocks (class). Even using the term class instead of function block is not common in PLC land. I started to apply some of these techniques myself, some I wrote about on LinkedIn, some I made such a hash of that I did not confess it on social media! Ive thought about how to actually use some of this without testing on a real project, hence this repo.
