## How To Use the Zone

So you've read the README, you know what this zone is for. This area is for curating a list of resources for those leanring to use.
These lists can be very specific.

The **[Resources.md](/Study%20Zone/Resources.md)** file will hold the list.

I prefer to split by topic rather than media, so we will create sections for TDD, OOP, Design Patterns, PackML etc

If you feel that the resource you have found better fits another heading, create the heading and add the resource.

We will review this file to check links and good categorisation as we go forward.
