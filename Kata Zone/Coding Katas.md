## Sorting your numbers

Really Simple as it goes or is it? :-)

There are times when we need to organise arrays, not having access to higher level language auto sort functions, or iterable collections we need to handle this directly.

Simply put take an array of INT, of any size and sort the elements by size, smallest to largest.

## Find the Largest

On a project I once needed to find the highest pressure in a data set. The data was returne as an array of LREALS, the array size was dependant on the application, typically an array of 20.

The Challenge is simple iterate through an array and find the largest number

## Whats my signal?

There are a number of application where you are required to output a very specific analogue signal, verying the amplitude and frequency as time goes on. 

What we want to do here is create a sinewave generator that is tied to the task cycle rate. You should be able to vary the frequency and amplitude and pass the signal as an array.
