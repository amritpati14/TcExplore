## Sorting your numbers

Really Simple as it goes or is it? :-)

There are times when we need to organise arrays, not having access to higher level language auto sort functions, or iterable collections we need to handle this directly.

Simply put take an array of INT, of any size and sort the elements by size, smallest to largest.
